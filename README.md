# About this project
The objective of this project was to link a database (mysql) with a user account. In order that the user could see his/her generated data from his/her computer.

The project consist in an irrigation system that generates data every XX minutes. The system sends the data to the user's database. The data consists in two variables, one is the flow of water injected and the other is the flow of one fertilizer. It is possible to add as many fertilizer as it is needed.
The user has access to a webpage, where he/she can see the data display in a linear graphic. Y axis is the flow (one for the water and another for the fertilizer/s) and X axis is time. To graph the data, it was used the plotly app.
